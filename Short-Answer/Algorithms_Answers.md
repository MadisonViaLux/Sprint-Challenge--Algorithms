#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(log n^3) Because "a" is a constant that gets slowly increased
until it reaches "n" which is being ^3


b) O(n^2) Because what we're iterating through ("n") is being 
multiplied by 2


c) O(n-1) Because the end result of "n" is being subtracted 
by 1

## Exercise II

I would say that the ground would be our starting point at 0, our
incrementing hight point would be "n", and then the floor or limit
that the eggs drop and break at would be "f". Then I would write 
a loop that says as long as "n" is <= "f" then "n" would be safe.
